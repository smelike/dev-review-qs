### Time complexity

Binary search trees(BST) versus Linear time

On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, 
insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. 

This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables.
